# Mill certificates 

## Current situation

Producers of steel products create mill certificates by 
* printing a document, signing and scanning it
* creating a PDF document
and sending it to buyers by email.

## Issues with current situation

The most important pain points in our understanding are:
* Scanned documents and PDFs are hard to process electronically so a lot of effort is spent on extracting only essential information manually in various steps of the value chain.
* Authenticity of documents cannot be verified easily so tampering with mill certificates happens all the time.

## New approach

Producers of steel products create mill certificates by 
* creating an electronic document with the data used in the past
* submitting it to the en10204.io platform

en10204.io
* validates the formal correctness of the electronic document
* renders a PDF document from the electronic document
* notarizes both the electronic document and the PDF on the blockchain with the producers signature
* sends the electronic document and the PDF by email to the buyer

## Benefits of new approach
The most important benefits are:
* both machines and humans are served well by the electronic document and the PDF
* the authenticity of the electronic document and the PDF can be verified on the blockchain
* minimal intervention into current business process - the generation of the output format changes
